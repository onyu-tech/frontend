this is our startup ok - 
ONYU is a smart wearable technology startup that builds everyday accessories with intelligence inside them. Our goal is to make technology innovative — instead of using traditional mouse or multiple devices, people can control and interact with technology naturally through what they wear.

Our first product is Jerry, a smart gesture ring. Jerry lets users control laptops, phones, and other devices using simple hand gestures — like a mouse in the air. It can be used for presentations, daily work, and hands-free control, and it also includes basic health tracking.

Jerry comes with a smart charging case, which can record audio and use AI to summarize important information. All data from Jerry is synced to the ONYU app.

ONYU is not just one product — it is building an ecosystem of wearables such as rings, bands, lockets and more. Every ONYU device shares the same app, the same user data, and the same AI assistant, so users can switch devices without losing their information.

Each wearable is designed for a different purpose — for example, a ring for productivity, a band for advanced health tracking, and safety-focused accessories for protection — but all work together as one system.

ONYU’s mission is to make advanced wearable technology affordable and accessible, especially for India, while creating a future where technology blends naturally into everyday life.
