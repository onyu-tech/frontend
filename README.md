# ONYU — Smart Wearables Ecosystem

ONYU is a smart wearable technology startup focused on everyday accessories with intelligence inside them. Our goal is to make technology feel natural and effortless — replacing traditional devices with subtle interactions you can wear.

We build a unified ecosystem where rings, bands, lockets, and safety accessories all connect through one app and one AI assistant. Your data stays continuous across devices so the experience feels seamless.

## Products

### Jerry — Smart Gesture Ring
Jerry is ONYU’s first product: a smart gesture ring that lets you control laptops, phones, and other screens with simple hand motions. It also includes basic health tracking and ships with a smart charging case that can record audio and generate AI summaries.

**Key capabilities:**
- Air-gesture control for navigation, presentations, and shortcuts
- Always‑ready AI case for capturing and summarizing important moments
- Unified sync with the ONYU app
- Lightweight, everyday‑wear design

### Ecosystem (In Progress)
ONYU is building a full ecosystem of wearables designed for different needs:
- **Rings** for productivity and control
- **Bands** for advanced health tracking
- **Safety accessories** for protection and alerts
- **Everyday pieces** like lockets and essentials

All devices share the same app, data layer, and AI assistant so users can switch without losing context.
